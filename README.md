# SOS Innovation Backend

This project is a **backend prototype** that demonstrates my custom logic for integrating a **Smart SOS safety feature into a mainstream application**.

The focus of this project is **backend decision-making and workflow design**, not a full mobile or web application.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To design and simulate how advanced women safety features (commonly seen in third-party apps) can be **integrated into a mainstream application at the backend level** using Python.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Context-aware SOS triggering  
- Emergency alert workflow design  
- Decoy mode behavior (background operation)  
- Media capture decision logic (audio / audio + video)  
- Location sharing during emergencies  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (High Level)

1. User triggers SOS
2. System identifies the **context** (e.g., walking alone, public place)
3. Backend decides:
   - Media type to capture
   - Whether decoy mode is enabled
4. Location and media reference are attached
5. Emergency alert is sent to trusted contacts

This entire flow is **simulated using Python** to demonstrate backend logic.

## 🧩 Features Implemented

- Simulated user database
- Context-based media selection
- Decoy mode simulation
- Emergency alert dispatch logic
- Timestamped media handling
- Location simulation (GPS placeholder)

## ❌ What This Project Does NOT Cover

- Mobile app UI
- Android/iOS system integration
- Real GPS or camera access
- Network-based alert delivery

> This repository focuses **only on backend logic and system design**.

---

## 💡 Innovation Highlight

While similar safety features exist in **third-party applications**, this project explores:

> **How such features can be architected and integrated into a mainstream app’s backend**, rather than built as a standalone safety app.

The innovation lies in **integration thinking and backend workflow design**, not in claiming a new invention.
